The files in this directory are static files used for the admin panel.
They were generated by django using the collectstatic command. They have been slightly tweaked. Colors and fonts have been altered. 

The parent directory (static) is hosted on a separated web server responsible for serving all static files. Having this directory (admin) placed inside the static directory enables serving of the admin static files in a similar fashion.
